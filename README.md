I'm Didintle Naledi Diseko, a graphic designer with a passion for software development. Here I will be showcasing my journey into the world of software development

## About Me

Before diving into software development, my journey began at Tshwane University of Technology, where I pursued Integrated Communication Design, which is basically just a better version of graphic design as it had modules such as photography, information design, interaction design, and motion design as at some institutions these modules are courses. Despite facing financial challenges that led me to discontinue my studies, my passion for interaction design introduced me to HTML and CSS, igniting my fascination with software development and ultimately guiding me to where I am today.
